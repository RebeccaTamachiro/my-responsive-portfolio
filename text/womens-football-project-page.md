# Women's Football website

<!-- Headline -->

## For visibility, worship and API practice

### Why have I built it

Team work, strategy, and a clear objective. The way these aspects can apply both to football itself and to this project is almost a coincidence, but I thought this could be a good way to start talking about the Women's Football website.

Although I was still coding on my own at the time, for this project I wanted to explore having a predifined and more ambicious end-goal, and then also commiting to organize my work using a [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/rYfBu3Yf/wf-website-revamp).

### The concept

<!--Use React to create a website that would engage visitors into wanting to learn more about a relevant women's football event. -->

### Down to code

<!--Using API and a online JSON storage to display curated content about the women's game. -->
