# Rebecca Tamachiro's Work Portfolio

This website was initially created as the final project for a [SheCodes Responsive](https://www.shecodes.io/responsive) workshop that I took on March/ April 2021.

For now, its live version can be accessed on https://affectionate-clarke-6f2167.netlify.app/ and a board for bugs and planned improvements has been created using [Trello](https://trello.com/b/xVJqfsqD/portfolio-continuous-development).

Following the workshop focus, the main initial efforts consisted in granting the website looks good both on desktop and mobile devices and so any features that required JavaScript or React were left for future improvements I will be working on on my own.
