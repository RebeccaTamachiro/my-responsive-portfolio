        <h3>Why have I built it</h3>
        <p>
          Team work, strategy, and a clear objective. The way these aspects can apply both to football itself and to this project
          is almost a coincidence, but I thought this could be a good way to start talking about the Women's Football website.
        </p>
        <p>  
          Although I was still coding on my own at the time, for this project I wanted to explore having a predifined and more
          ambitious end-goal, and then also committing to organize my work using a <a href="https://trello.com/b/rYfBu3Yf/wf-website-revamp" target="_blank">Trello board</a>.

            <h3>The Concept</h3>
            <p>
              As this was a project I started after learning React, one of the first requirements I set was that it had to have
              interactive content.
            </p>
            <p>
              The 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup had just been on and with more and more people (finally) giving the women's game a bit
              of attention I thought it could be a cool idea to let visitors search for different countries and learn how they did on
              the tournament.
            </p>
            <img src="/images/womens-football-interactive.png" class="img-fluid d-block d-xl-none mx-auto mb-3 rounded"
              alt="Womens Football search feature" />
            <p>
              I was also dreaming high in terms of maybe being able to set up a simple database to pull this information from; and in
              terms of API, having curated news and displaying live game scores.
            </p>
            <p>  
              Basically a future all-in-one website with everything you needed to know about women's football.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <h3>Down to code</h3>
        <img src="/images/womens-football-code-snap.png" class="img-fluid d-none d-lg-block mx-auto my-4 rounded" alt="Womens Football code snap"/>
        <img src="/images/womens-football-code-square.png" class="img-fluid d-block d-lg-none mx-auto my-4 rounded" alt="Womens Football code snap"/>
        <p>
        After searching for database and API options and documenting the information on Trello cards, I soon noticed I would
        have to change the approach for some of the intended features. The API for live scores was paid, so this one was
        removed, and what I implemented in the end was only the curated news and the FIFA World Cup interactive search.
        </p>
        <p>
        To fetch specific info depending on the country, I used an online JSON storage that supported http calls. This way I
        could manage the content directly on the JSON object and continue to use Axios to get the information. As soon as the
        response is captured from the storage, a piece of code can map its atributes to the values and pass them to be displayed
        on what I called the SearchedTeam React component.
